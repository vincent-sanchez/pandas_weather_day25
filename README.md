main.py file was created for Day 25 of the 100 Days of Code: Python course from Dr. Angela Yu. 

This project uses 1 python file to read a list of names from the 'weather_data.csv' file provided. The program is grouped by the different sections that use different methologies to read the data file into the Python interpretter. The last uncommented section utlilzies the pandas framework to read the CSV file into a data frame and prints the contents of the 'temp' field.
